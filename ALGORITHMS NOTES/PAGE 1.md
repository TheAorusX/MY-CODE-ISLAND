ALGORITHMS:

Algorithm is a step by step procedure of solving a problem
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALGORITHM AND PROGRAM
ALGORITHM:
> It's a design that will be followed during the coding of the program
> Person who writes the algorithm must have domain knowledge realted to the problem
> Can be written in any language and even mathametical notations can be used
> Doesnt depend on operating system
> Useful for analyzing the iverall program
PROGRAM:
> It's written when we are going to implement the program to solve the problem
> Porgrammer has to be written based on the design set in algorithm
> Has to be written in a perticular programming language
> Sometimes Depends on operating system (depends on language used) 
> Testing is done
