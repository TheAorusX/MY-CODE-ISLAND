>how to write an algorithm to swap 2 numbers

Algorithm Swap(a,b)
{ //begin
    temp = a; ___1
    a=b; ________2
    b=temp; _____3
} //end

>HOW TO ANALYZE AN ALGORITHMS
1. Time
2. Space
3. Network
4. Power
5. Specs (memory,cpu,registers,etc)

1. Every simple statement in a program takes 1 unit of time 
so the time functions of the alogrithm is f(n)=3
2. a, b and temp takes 1 unit of space hence space function s(n)=3
we can also say s(n)=3 as "3 words"
