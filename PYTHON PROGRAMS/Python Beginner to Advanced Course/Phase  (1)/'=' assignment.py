"""
The `=` operator in Python is used for assignment, meaning it assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left. This is not a function, but a fundamental language feature that creates or updates variables with new values. Assignment can be used with numbers, strings, lists, and even the result of expressions or function calls. It is essential for storing data, updating state, and enabling further computation in your programs.

# Example usage of the assignment operator `=`
x = 5                # Assigns integer 5 to variable x
name = "Alice"       # Assigns string "Alice" to variable name
numbers = [1, 2, 3]  # Assigns a list to variable numbers
y = x + 10           # Assigns the result of x + 10 to y
flag = True          # Assigns boolean True to variable flag
