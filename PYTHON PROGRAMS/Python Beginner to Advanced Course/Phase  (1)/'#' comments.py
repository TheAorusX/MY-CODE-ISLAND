"""
In Python, the '#' symbol is used to write comments. Comments are lines in the code that are ignored by the Python interpreter and are meant for programmers to add notes or explanations. They help make the code more readable and maintainable. Comments can be placed on their own line or at the end of a code line.

# This is a single-line comment
x = 5  # Assign 5 to variable x
# Print the value of x
print(x)  # Output the value of x
# The following line adds two numbers
result = x + 10  # Add 10 to x and store in result
