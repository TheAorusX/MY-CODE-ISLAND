This course is designed to take absolute beginners through the fundamental building blocks of Pythonâ€”starting from simple keywords like print, if, and else, and gradually advancing to functions, loops, classes, and more. Carefully structured in ascending order of complexity, each lesson builds on the last, ensuring learners gain confidence and clarity every step of the way. By the end, students will not only understand Python syntax but also develop the problem-solving mindset of a programmer.

# BELLOW IS THE ORGANISED TABLE OF ALL THE PHASES OF THE COURSE ORGANISED IN A BEGINNER FRIENDLY SEQUENCE

Phase 1: Absolute Beginner 
Core concepts every programmer needs immediately
1. print() - Display output to the user
2. input() - Get information from the user
3. '=' (assignment) - Store values in variables
4. '#' (comments) - Add notes to your code
5. int(), str(), float() - Convert between data types


Phase 2: Basic Logic 
Making decisions and simple comparisons
6. if - Make decisions in your code
7. else - Handle the alternative case
8. elif - Handle multiple conditions
9. ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= - Compare values
10. and, or, not - Combine logical conditions
11. True, False - Boolean values


Phase 3: Repetition and Structure 
Doing things multiple times efficiently
12. for - Repeat actions a specific number of times
13. while - Repeat actions until a condition changes
14. range() - Generate sequences of numbers
15. len() - Find the length of collections
16. break - Exit from loops early
17. continue - Skip to the next loop iteration


Phase 4: Data Collections 
Working with multiple pieces of information
18. list - Store multiple items in order
19. append(), remove(), pop() - Modify lists
20. dict - Store key-value pairs
21. tuple - Store unchangeable collections
22. set - Store unique items
23. in - Check if something exists in a collection


Phase 5: Code Organization 
Breaking code into reusable pieces
24. def - Create your own functions
25. return - Send results back from functions
26. pass - Create placeholder code blocks
27. import - Use code from other files
28. from - Import specific parts of modules


Phase 6: Error Handling 
Dealing with problems gracefully
29. try - Attempt code that might fail
30. except - Handle specific errors
31. finally - Code that always runs
32. raise - Create your own errors
Phase 7: Advanced Concepts (Week 7-8)

Phase 7: More sophisticated programming techniques
33. class - Create custom data types
34. self - Refer to the current object
35. init() - Set up new objects
36. with - Manage resources automatically
37. lambda - Create small anonymous functions
38. yield - Create generators for memory efficiency


Phase 8: Expert Level 
Professional programming concepts
39. global - Access variables from outer scope
40. nonlocal - Access variables from enclosing functions
41. assert - Test assumptions in your code
42. del - Remove variables or objects
43. is - Test object identity
44. None - Represent absence of value
